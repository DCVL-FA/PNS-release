(a) Examples of correctly detected as real faces in intra-dataset test. (b) Examples of correctly detected as fake faces in intra-dataset test. (c) Examples of the failure cases (i.e., real$\rightarrow$fake (left five samples) and fake$\rightarrow$real (right five samples)) in intra-dataset test. (d) Examples of correctly detected as real faces in inter-dataset test. (e) Examples of correctly detected as fake faces in inter-dataset test.
